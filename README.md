# Predictive Analytics for Asthma Related Emergency Visits
Predictive Analytics for Asthma-Related Emergency Visits: A Machine Learning Approach to Proactive Healthcare


---

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting whether individuals with asthma will visit emergency rooms or urgent care centers within a year. Using the **2021 BRFSS Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS)** dataset, I built a high-performance machine learning model to identify high-risk patients, enabling timely interventions and reducing healthcare costs.

## Key Objectives  
1. **Predict Asthma-Related Emergency Visits:** Classify individuals into "high-risk" (emergency visit) or "low-risk" (no visit) categories.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identify the most significant predictors of emergency visits using techniques like LASSO, PCA, and Information Gain.
3. **Model Optimization:** Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to achieve the highest predictive accuracy.

## Process Overview  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values using mean imputation and removed columns with >25% missing data.  
   - Removed zero-variance features and highly correlated variables to reduce noise.  
   - Detected and analyzed outliers using the IQR method.  

2. **Balancing the Dataset:**  
   - Addressed class imbalance using **under-sampling** and **bootstrap resampling** techniques.  

3. **Feature Selection:**  
   - Applied **LASSO Regression**, **PCA**, and **Information Gain** to identify the most predictive features.  

4. **Model Building:**  
   - Trained and evaluated **6 classification algorithms**: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, and KNN.  
   - Used **stratified train-test splits** to ensure balanced evaluation.  

5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
   - Selected the best-performing model: **XGBoost with Bootstrap Resampling and Information Gain**.  

6. **Results & Insights:**  
   - Achieved **93.47% accuracy** and **>92% TPR** for both classes.  
   - Identified key predictors of asthma-related emergency visits, such as **duration of asthma symptoms** and **hospital visits**.

## Project Complexity  
This project involved building and evaluating **36 unique models** to ensure the best predictive performance. Here's how the complexity was structured:  

1. **2 Balancing Techniques:**  
   - **Under-sampling:** Randomly reduced the majority class to match the minority class.  
   - **Bootstrap Resampling:** Created balanced datasets by resampling with replacement.  

2. **3 Feature Selection Methods:**  
   - **LASSO Regression:** Identified key features by shrinking less important coefficients to zero.  
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Reduced dimensionality by transforming features into principal components.  
   - **Information Gain:** Selected features based on their contribution to predicting the target variable.  

3. **6 Classification Algorithms:**  
   - **Random Forest**  
   - **XGBoost**  
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**  
   - **Decision Trees**  
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

By combining **2 balancing techniques**, **3 feature selection methods**, and **6 classification algorithms**, I rigorously tested and compared **36 models** to identify the best-performing solution. This approach ensured robustness, reliability, and high predictive accuracy.
